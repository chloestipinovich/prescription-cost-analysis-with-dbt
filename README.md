# prescription-cost-analysis-with-dbt
This project explores and transforms the NHS Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) dataset for FY 2024/25 using DBT (Data Build Tool). The goal is to build a clean, modular, and testable analytics pipeline that enables insights into prescribing patterns, drug costs, and regional prescribing behaviour across England.
